			<h1> Introduction to the course</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to an intro to web development. I'm really excited to teach you a bit about how to become a web
				developer. In this course we assume you know absolutely nothing about writing code. We do assume that you
				have a basic grasp of how to operate your computer: how to browse the Internet, how to operate your
			operating system, how to use a keyboard and mouse, etc.</p>
			<p>You should be able to skip lessons you know. However the review can be helpful.</p>
			<h2>Tips to Succeed In This Course</h2>
			<p>Contrary to what many people believe, you do not have to be a wizard with math to write code. The two
				subjects share some overlap but also are quite different. Many artists, lawyers, historians, linguists, and
				others have great success learning how to code. Don't let those preconceived notions hold you back at all.
			</p>
			<p>Also keep in mind that this is hard. Learning how to code is hard. It's similar to learning a foreign
				language where you have to learn a lot of small pieces of information to be able to make sense of the larger
				picture. It's easy to feel discouraged, especially when you feel like you should get something but don't.
				Keep your head up and keep trying. Walk away from the problem and come back later. Try explaining your
				problem to someone / your dog / a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"
				target="_blank" title="RUBBER DUCKY"> rubber ducky</a> (seriously, it works.)</p>
				<p>Never feel afraid to Google anything. Every programmer you know, from the top person in the field to the
					newest student is Googling things constantly. This isn't cheating; it's a skill. It's a requirement. There
					is so much information coming at you that cannot possibly remember it all. Copy and paste code. Look at
					StackOverflow. Ask dumb questions. You get better by repeatedly exposing yourself to information. Each time
				a bit more will sink in.</p>
				<p>Don't try to understand every piece all at once. There are times where it's okay to just trust that something
					works and come back later to understand how. It's a tough balance because you do want to try to understand
					what's going on. I'll try to signal to you what's worth diving into and what's worth leaving for another day
				but just know you don't have to understand it all at once.</p>
				<p>Lastly, this isn't a get-rich-quick scheme. Learning to code is hard and requires a lot of hard work. While
					entry-level jobs are out there and you can get them with months of work, I guarantee you you'll have to work
				hard for them.</p>
