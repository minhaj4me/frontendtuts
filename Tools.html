            <h1>Tools</h1>
            <p>
                Before we get started, we need to set you up with all the necessary tools you're going to need to get up and
                going. As I said previously, I use macOS to write code on but nearly everything I'm going to suggest has
                Windows equivalents and some have Linux equivalents as well. While I'm not a Windows or Linux dev (or least
                haven't been for a long time) I'll try to make sure we get you in with some good tools. What's important
                here is that you find what works for you. Every developer has very strong opinions about their tools and
                will tell you that is some reason you have to use their tool. Don't listen to them. Find what works for you.
                If you find yourself fighting your tools more than they're helping you, consider trying something else. Keep
                an open mind. What's shiny or popular is not necessarily going to work for you. Take time to invest in
                making your tools work the best for you. Small wins amount to huge boosts in productivity in the long term.
            </p>
            <h2>
            The Browser
            </h2>
            <p> One of your biggest allies in writing websites is the web browser. You may not be yet aware but your browser
                has a myriad of developer tools built into it that help you understand your code, helps you find bugs, and
                helps you experiment directly on your running website. All of the modern browsers are great and you can use
                any one of them to develop sites with. I recommend you pick one and really get to know its developers tools.
            </p>
            <h2>
            My Recommendation: Firefox ---->
            <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/" title="Download Directly" target="_blank">Download
            Firefox</a>
            </h2>
            <p>
                I've been a big Mozilla fan for a long time and Firefox just keeps getting better. The developer tools are
                amazing and the team behind them are amazing too. All of my workshop will be done using Firefox.
            </p>
            <p>
                That being said, Edge, Safari, or <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank"
                title="Download Directly"> Chrome</a> are all very, very good browsers with great dev tools too. If you
                feel comfortable with one of these already, stick with it. If you're using Safari,<a
                    href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternetWeb/Conceptual/Web_Inspector_Tutorial/EnableWebInspector/EnableWebInspector.html"
                target="_blank" title="Check it Once"> make sure you enable dev tools.</a>

            The Editor
            </h2>
            <p>
                One of the most controversial things you can ask a developer is which editor is the best. There are so many
                strongly-held opinions that it's hard to tell which one is going to work for you. There are many flavors and
                it all depends on what you want out of your editor: do you want it to hold your hand as much as possible? Do
                you want it to get out of the way? I'm going to give you several choices but let's start with what I've been
                using for a few years now.
            </p>
            <h2>
            My Recommedation: Visual Studio Code --> <a href="https://aka.ms/visual-studio-code" target="_blank"
            title="Download Directly">Download V S Code</a>
            </h2>
            <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly I'm choosing the editor that Microsoft created. However I've been using VSCode (which
                is how I'll refer to Visual Studio Code from now on) since I was working at Netflix. It's a fantastic editor
                that has a lot of convenient features and helpers. To me it's the right balance of minimalism and helpers.
                It works in particular really well with front end development as well, and since the editor itself is
                JavaScript-based, if you ever feel like adding a new feature or plugin to it, you'll already know the
                correct language to do so. It's free, open-source, and works well on Mac, Linux, and Windows. And perhaps
                one of the best features of VSCode is it has a <a href="https://aka.ms/vscode-marketplace" target="_blank"
                title="You Can Check This">huge amount of available plug ins</a> </p>
                <p>If you're not feeling VSCode, two other editors that are similar in their offering are <a
                href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank" title="Directly Download"> Sublime Text 3</a> and <a
            href="https://atom.io/" target="_blank" title="Directly Download"> Atom</a>. Both are great. I used
            Sublime for a decade and I still like it. Both are free to download. Sublime has an unlimited trial that
        asks you to pay $80 when you can.</p>
        <p> If you want a more complete offering, you may investigate using an integrated development environment
            (commonly called an IDE.) The reigning, best IDE for front end development is <a
            href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/" target="_blank" title="Check This"> WebStorm</a>. WebStorm is
            a very powerful IDE that has a lot of features and tools built into it. It aims to be more than just an
        editor; it aims to be the entire development suite. Great tool.</p>
        <p> Lastly, I'm going to simply state there are two more tools you could use: <a href="https://www.vim.org/"
        target="_blank" title="Check This"> vim </a> and <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"
    target="_blank" title="Check This"> emacs</a>. These are tool that you use in the command line /
    terminal and use just the keyboard, no mouse. These tools have a very difficult learning curve but once
    you're productive in them they allow you to go very fast. My advice for you is: don't, especially right now
    as you're learning to code. If you want to revisit it later then you could do that. But just know that it is
indeed quite difficult.</p>
<h2>
The Terminal
</h2>
<p>
    You're going to learn to use a terminal during this workshop. It's less scary than it seems, I promise!
    There are two things to worry about when talking about the terminal, and I'll try to help you tell the
    difference between the two: the <b> shell</b> and the <b>terminal emulator</b>. The terminal emulator is the
    actual window in your operating system; it itself doesn't execute or understand your commands you're sending
    to it. The shell is the code running inside of the terminal emulator. This shell can be swapped out to
    whatever shell you want to run. Unlike the things I recommended above, these various terminal emulators and
    shells vary a lot more by operating system.
</p>
<p>
    If this is confusing to you, it's okay. It's a minor detail that you can come back to later.
</p>
<p>
    For the terminal emulator, it doesn't matter a whole lot which one you use. I personally use <a
    href="https://www.iterm2.com/" target="_blank" title="Check This"> iTerm2 </a> but you can just as
    easily use the default Mac Terminal.app or <a href="https://hyper.is/" target="_blank" title="Check This">
    Hyper </a> for Mac. For Windows, I'm told the aforementioned Hyper also works well as well as <a
href="http://cmder.net/" target="_blank" title="Check This"> cmder </a>. If you're on Linux, I'd say
just use whatever the OS's default emulator is. You can use any one of these and this workshop will function
entirely the same.
</p>
<p>
For the shell, we are going to use <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/" target="_blank"
title="Check This"> bash </a> . You don't need to install it unless you're using Windows ( <a
href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target="_blank" title="Check This">
then use these steps to enable it </a> ). It's 99% already there on your computer unless you're using
some obscure flavor of Linux. Whenever you open your Mac terminal, it'll be running bash by default unless
you've changed it.
</p>
<p>
There are other options. The reason we use bash is because it is so prevalent. Bash is everywhere.
Everything you Google will have the answers written in bash. My favorite shell is actually <a
href="https://fishshell.com/" target="_blank" title="Check This"> fish </a> but it's not very popular.
Another shell people swear by is <a href="http://www.zsh.org/" title="Check This" target="_blank"> zsh </a>
. These are all very cool but I recommend looking at these later.
</p>
<h2>
Trusted Resources
</h2>
<p>
Something really important is that you choose to learn from good sources. Just like it's important to get
your news from quality sources, it's important to get your technical information from sound sources. Here
are some of my personal favorites:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For anything to do with HTML, CSS, or JavaScript, Mozilla's <a
href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" title="Check This" target="_blank"> MDN </a> is my
go-to. I literally have it open all the time.
</li> <br>
<li>
CSS Tricks has fashioned itself into a premier development website. It has great content not just for
CSS but for HTML and JavaScript too. If I want a tutorial, I'll head there. If I want more technical
how-to info, I head to MDN.
</li><br>
<li>
If I'm working with a library or a framework, it's a good idea to head directly to their GitHub (we'll
talk about GitHub later) page or their official documentation. It's best to head straight to the source.
