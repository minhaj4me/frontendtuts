            <p>
                We just discussed what the basic building block of HTML is: tags. We're going to explore a bit more about
                what you can do with tags and then we'll move on to CSS.

            <p>
                <p> Let's start with a text</p>
                <b>
                <xmp>input</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> tag. There are several types of</p>
                <b>
                <xmp> inputs</xmp>
                </b>
                <p>that we discussed in the previous section: text, color, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc. How can the browser
                    tell which is meant to be what? HTML attributes! Attributes are additional pieces of information that you
                can attach to HTML tags. We're going to use the</p>
                <b>
                <xmp> type</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> attribute to pass that to the browser.</p>
            </p>
            <div class="a">
                <b>
                <xmp>
                <input type="checkbox" />
                <input type="color" />

                </b>
                <p> is considered an attribute. Different tags have different attributes that they care about. For example, the
                </p>
                <b>
                <xmp> type</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> attribute is not useful with</p>
                <b>
                <xmp> p, div, h1,</xmp>
                </b>
                <p>etc. You can still put a</p>
                <b>
                <xmp> type</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> attribute on these tags; they'll just ignore them.</p>

            <p> aren't the only ones to use attributes. In fact they are used everywhere in HTML. This is just to
                demonstrate to you what they look like and how certain attributes do certain things. If something isn't
                working for you, always check to see if you misspelled one of the tag names or attributes; that's an easy
                thing to mess up and hard to tell it happened.

            <h2>
            Classes
            </h2>
            <p>
                Classes are special attributes that can go on any tag, though some you won't use it with. While a class does
                nothing itself, it allows that tag to be found by your CSS and your JavaScript. Using our house analogy, you
                don't want to make a rule that says "all walls are south facing." It's nonsensical and you could never build
            a house that way. Instead, you'd make a rule that says "walls marked</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> south-facing-wall</xmp>
            </b>
            <p>are south facing." This is what classes allow you to do: they allow you to mark your HTML so you can write
                rules and code to govern them later. Let's see what that looks like.

                    What you see above is very typical looking HTML. Most tags will have classes. Now when I go to write CSS
                later, I can target just</p>
                <b>
                <xmp> post-titles.</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> If I wrote a rule targeting</p> <b>
                <xmp> h1s,</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> I'd get all the</p>
                <b>
                <xmp> post-titles</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> and the</p>
                <b>
                <xmp> header-title</xmp>
                </b>
                <p> as well. As you may imagine, you'll want the site header's h1 to look and act different than the blog post
                title, just like the headers in this lesson look different than the "INTRO TO WEB DEV V2" in the header.</p>
            </p>
            <h2>
            ID<sub>s
            </sub>
            </h2>
            <p>IDs are far less useful than classes. Whereas you'll be using classes everywhere and frequently, you should
            be using IDs very sparingly. As you see in our above</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> blog-posts</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> HTML, we can re-use classes like</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> post</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> and</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> post-title.</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> This is extremely important. As a coder, you want a piece of code and use it a lot. As coders, we want to
                write as little code as possible (which we'll explore why later, for now trust me.) For now, be satisfied
            that I get to write a little bit of code that governs</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> post</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> and have it affect every</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> post,</xmp>
            </b>
            <p>on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's contrast that with IDs. When you designate something with an ID, you're affirming that<strong> this is
                the only one of those on your website.</strong> Not even just that page, but your whole website.
                Sometimes that is useful; just not very often. Some other coders and tutorials will tell you to never use
                IDs; I think that's misguided. IDs are a sledgehammer. Most problems don't require a sledgehammer. However
                sometimes you have problems that need a sledgehammer and then you're really grateful that you have one.
            </p>
            <p>Let's see what an ID would look like:
            </p>
            <div class="c">

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
            Notice the first blog post has an</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> id</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> attribute in addition to its class. Notice I gave it a name very specific to that post; I can probably
                guarantee that the only house metaphor post on my website so that name works. Later we'll go more in depth
                on this, but you don't want to use CSS to tag IDs. You probably don't need to use JavaScript to target it;
                classes normally suffice.
            </p>
            <p> So why do we have them? Well, they're really old and have been around forever so that's the mean reason.
                Another reason that is very useful about IDs is that I now can make a link that takes you directly to that
                ID in the page. Try clicking this <a href="#the-h1-part-way-down-the-page" title="Just move down">link </a>
                (it won't leave this page.)
            </p>
            <h2>
            The link should bring you here.
            </h2>
            <p>
            This is done using just an ID. The code for that link is:</p><br>
            <b>
            <xmp> <a href="#the-h1-part-way-down-the-page">link</a>.</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> That</p>
            <b>
            <xmp>#</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> means go to that ID on the page.
            </p>
            <h2>
            Naming and Tags to Use
            </h2>
            <p>
                You generally want to give things useful names. There's a saying in computer science that there are two hard
                things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors. (Cache invalidation is
                another topic for another day.) So if you struggle to come up with names for things like classes and IDs,
                you're not alone. As a programmer you get to name a lot of things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Generally, with classes, you want to name things semantically. This is a fancy word (often used when talking
                about HTML) that you want use tags and name things as close to what thing is and <strong>not</strong> what
                it looks like.
            </p>
            <p>
                Example, imagine this is a blog post on my website.

                For the blog post title, what should I call the class? What tag should I use? I really can use any tag and
                it'll mechanically work. Using CSS, you can make pretty much any tag look and act like any other. So if it
                doesn't matter mechanically, why should it matter to me? The same reasons we layed out earlier:
            </p><br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>It makes the site accessible to everyone if you choose good tags. It's your responsibility to make
                        sure the web remains accessible to everyone, including but not limited to: people with limited
                        sight, limited motion of hands, arms or other limbs, limited hearing, and other permanent or
                    temporary disabilities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It'll make it easier for you to come back later and maintain your code or for someone else to
                    understand what you did. Code is communication between you and future readers.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>It makes it easier for Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. to crawl your website which means your site
                    will rank higher.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            Given that, it means we need to choose a tag that means that's a title. In this case, we can use an</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> h1</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> because that is the main header of that subsection. For the name of the class (note screen readers and other
                accessibility tools do not read your class names or IDs; choosing good names here purely affects you and
                others working on this code.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Okay, cool, so let's give that</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> h1</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> a good class name. How about</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> red-title?</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> It's a title and it's red; fits, right? While that may seem appropriate and fitting now, what if you need to
                change your blog's styling the following week and now that blog post looks like this:
            </p>
            <article class="art">
                <h4>
                MY COOL BLOG POST TITLE
                </h4>
                <p> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Sint exercitationem dignissimos veritatis, odit
                    accusamus reiciendis dolorum ab harum dolorem ad et ducimus amet ut eos, itaque nostrum cumque magni
                soluta.</p>
            </article>
            <p>
            If your title is still called</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> red-title,</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> you have a bit of a problem! Now your class name is not only not descriptive of what the item is, it's
                actually wrong which will make it way more confusing to you and other laters. Now, you may say that you can
                just change the class name when you go to update but believe me that's not a good option either. If you've
                used that class 1,000 times throughout your website (not that farfetched) you'd have to update 1,000
                different things. No, it's better if we give it a good name the first time, descriptive of not what it looks
            like but descriptive of what role it serves. In this case, we could call it something like</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> blog-post-title</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> or</p>
            <b>
            <xmp> post-head</xmp>
            </b>
            <p> or something of that nature. That class then always be descriptive of what the thing is and not what it
                looks like.
            </p>
