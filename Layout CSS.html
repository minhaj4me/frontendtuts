      <p>
        CSS can also be used to layout the page differently. Without this, you couldn't have two boxes next to each other,
        like this:
      </p>
      <b>
      <xmp>
      <style>
      .ex-box {
      border: 3px solid #aaa;

      width: 200px;

        background-color: #eee;
        height: 200px;
        width: 200px;
        display: flex;
        align-items: center;
        justify-content: center;
        float: left;
        margin-right: 10px;
        border-radius: 5px;
        font-size: 30px;
        }
        .ex-box:last-of-type {
        clear: right;
        }
        </style>
        <div class="ex-box">Box 1</div>
        <div class="ex-box">Box 2</div>
      </div>
      <p>Those are just two <span>div</span>s with some text inside. Without CSS, we wouldn't be able to control the
      width, height, the fact that they're side-by-side instead of on different lines, the space between them, or the
      vertical and horizontal centering of the text. We're getting into the more layout-oriented CSS.
    </p>
    <h2>The Box Model
    </h2>
    <p>We're going to talk about what is call the <b>box model</b> of CSS. This is one of the most confusing thing for
      people new to CSS to grasp at front, so it's worth investing time into understanding. It's important.
    </p>
    <h2>Display
    </h2>
    <p>Every tag in CSS has a <span>display</span> property associated with it by default. In fact, CSS has a lot of
    hidden defaults, just like by-default all text's color is black. With <span>display</span>, it varies by what type
    of tag we're talking about. <span>div</span>s are<span>display: block;</span> by default while <span>span</span>s
    are <span>display: inline;</span> and this makes sense given their functions. However, being that we have access
    to CSS, we can manipulate a <span>span</span> to act like a <span>div</span> and vice-versa (though usually you'd
    just use the appropriate tag.) We'll list out a few of the options here of what <span>display</span> can be.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><span>inline</span> – Like it sounds, it makes whatever the <span>tag</span> is behave like text. If you I
      want to style some text inline, this is how to do. The key here is the browser will determine all the height,
      width, padding, margins, etc. for you and will not let you change it. This is a common pitfall for those
      learning. If you have something and you're trying to set the width or height and it's not respecting it, it's
      probably the wrong <span>display</span> type.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span>block</span> – <span>div</span>s and <span>p</span>s by default are <span>display: block;</span>. This
      give you control over the height, width, padding, margins, etc. of something. By default, something that is
      <span>block</span> takes the whole line to itself.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span>inline-block</span> – A hybrid of the previous two. This will make browser try to place the tag inline,
    but will still allow you to control the height, width, padding, and margins.</p>
    <p> Like this box:
      <div class="green-box"></div>
    </p>
    <p> This wouldn't be possible with either of the previous.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span>flex</span> and <span>inline-flex</span> – Similar to <span>block</span> in that it affects the tags
    around it like <span>block</span> does, however it gains some new super power on how its interior tags are
    layed out. There's a section below where we'll talk about <span>flex</span>.
  </p>
</li>
<li>
  <p><span>grid</span> and <span>inline-grid</span> – More advance display mode that allow you more power to
  layout tags inside of them. CSS-Tricks and Frontend Masters both have useful tutorials on these and they are
  definitely worth your time.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>table</span> – Make something act like a <span>table</span>. In general, use the </p><b>
<xmp>
<table></table>
</xmp>
</b>
<p>tag instead of using CSS to make things act like <span>tables</span>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
Height, Width, Padding, Border, and Margin
</h2>
<p>Again, these properties cannot be manipulated if something is <span>display: inline</span>. Be careful of that.
</p>
<p>
Something is a<span>block</span> or <span>block</span>-like has several measurements that add up to its whole.
</p>
<div class="blue-box">
<div class="red-box">
<div class="green-border">
Interior Content
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
I'm using several elements here to concretely demonstrate how the box model works, but assume it was all one
<span>div</span> tag. The css would look like:
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
.example {
border: 3px solid red;
padding: 5px;
margin: 25px;
background-color: white;
}
</xmp>
</b>
<p>
The <span>background-color</span> of the parent of the container is <span>blue</span>. The <span>2px dashed
green</span> border is added by me to show padding. So let's pick this apart, starting from the outside and
working in.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>margin</span> – This is the space <b>outside</b> of the element between it and other elements. It is
outside of the border. If you give something a <span>background-color</span>, it will not color in the margin
space. This is used to space elements out from other elements.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>border</span> – Next is the border. If your element has a border, it comes next (not everything has or
needs a border.)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>padding</span> – Inside the border is the <span>padding</span>. This is the spacing <b>inside</b> the
element. If you give something a <span>background-color</span>, you will color the padding space. In our
diagram above, you can see the space between the red, solid border and the green, dashed border. This is the
padding of the element.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Right now, the above element doesn't have a set <span>height</span> or <span>width</span>, which means it will
take its height from what ever inside of it and it will try to take <span>100%</span> of the width it can. We can
modify both of these. However, if I say <span>width: 200px</span>, what is 200px wide? Unfortunately, the answer
is it depends. It depends on what the value of the <span>box-sizing</span> property. By default, it does things
the old way of writing code which if I say <span>width: 200px</span> I am not including the <span>border or the
<span>padding</span>. This is annoying because if I'm trying to fit things together well, it's much easier to
include <span>border</span> and <span>padding</span>. Remember how I told you to never use the wild card
selector before? This is the one exception where I permiss you to:
</p>
<br>
<b>
<xmp>* {
box-sizing: border-box;
}</xmp>
</b>
<p>This will make everything use the <span>border-box</span> sizing instead of the default one (which is called
<span>content-box</span> but you'll never have to know that.) This is the first thing I put in every project I
start. You'll need it once in one file. This will make everything by-default be <span>border-box</span> and thus
be easier to work with. This used to be controversial to use but <a
href="https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/" target="_blank" title="GO AND CHECK THAT">here
is Paul Irish (really smart guy who works on Google Chrome)</a> saying it's okay.
</p>
<h2>Laying Out Tags
</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to accomplish layouts. We'll briefly discuss two: floats and flex. There is also grid, but
it's still new which means a significant of people's computers don't support it and the best practices for it are
still being ironed out. In addition, you don't need it right away.
</p>
<p>We're going to be using these boxes a lot over the next examples. Here's the CSS if you want to play with them:
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.box-1 {
border: 1px solid black;
color: white;
background-color: blue;
height: 150px;
width: 300px;
}
.box-2 {
border: 1px solid black;
color: white;
background-color: red;
height: 100px;
width: 300px;
}
.box-3 {
border: 1px solid black;
color: white;
background-color: green;
height: 200px;
width: 100px;
}
</style>
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div< /xmp>
</b>
<div class="b">
Result--
<style>
.box-1 {
border: 1px solid black;
color: white;
background-color: blue;
height: 150px;
width: 300px;
}
.box-2 {
border: 1px solid black;
color: white;
background-color: red;
height: 100px;
width: 300px;
}
.box-3 {
border: 1px solid black;
color: white;
background-color: green;
height: 200px;
width: 100px;
}
</style>
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div </div>
<h2>Floats</h2>
<p>The old, bullet-proof of laying things is using a property called <span>float</span>. The idea behind float is
you'll an element to push itself as far left or right as possible, and once it's out of space, go to the next
line. I'll put an example on the line below. Try resizing your browser horizontally and see the boxes re-arrange
themselves.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.floated div {
float: left;
}
</style>
<div class="floated">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="c">Result--
<style>
.floated div {
float: left;
}
</style>
<div class="floated">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>You'll see the boxes will wrap themselves once they run out of room and box 3 wraps as you would expect.
However, once you wrap <b>both</b> boxes 2 and 3, you'll see that box 3 won't go all the way up next to 1; it
stays at the same vertical position as 2. Since box 2 is higher in the HTML, box 3 cannot go higher on the page
due to the way that CSS works. This is just one limitation of floats. They have peculiar behavior that's tough
to understand. Let's move on and talk about flex which makes it much easier to handle.
</p>
<h2>Flex</h2>
<p><span>display: flex</span>; is a display mode for CSS. It's to note that when you stick <span>display:
float</span>, it allows you to to change the layout <b>inside</b> the tag. It allows you to change the layout
of its children. Externally, it acts just like <span>block</span>. Likewise there is a <span>inline-flex</span>
which acts just like <span>display: inline-block</span> externally.
</p>
<p>Flex allows for a lot of interesting patterns but we're going to scratch the surface today. Read the <a
href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/" title="HAVE A LOOK" target="_blank"> CSS Tricks
article</a> to learn more. We're going to explore same case today. Flex lets you tell CSS how to lay out the
items inside a tag. We can tell the them to be left aligned, bottom aligned, center aligned, whatever you want.
You can even throw them into columns. I think this is best taught by example so let's just throw a bunch on the
page. All of them will have the following CSS:
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.flex-container {
display: flex;
width: 100%;
border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="d">
Result--
<style>
.flex-container {
display: flex;
width: 100%;
border: 1px solid black;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And we'll just be changing three properties: <span>flex-direction</span>, <span>justify-content</span>, and
<span>align-items</span>. Nothing special will go on the boxes, just the style to make the colored boxes. So
let's throw a bunch examples up.
</p>
<p>No changes made, just the above CSS and HTML.
</p>
<p>Looks similar to the floats, but notice if you make the page more narrow, the boxes will squish instead of
wrapping.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.reverse {
flex-direction: row-reverse;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container reverse">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="e">
Result--
<style>
.reverse {
flex-direction: row-reverse;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container reverse">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>It's backwards! Easy as pie to do it with flex. We can even make it a column!
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.column {
flex-direction: column;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container column">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="b">
Result--
<style>
.column {
flex-direction: column;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container column">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Okay, so now we've done columns, (also, <span>column-reverse</span> works as you would expect) we're going to
try affecting how the items are justified.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.jc-right {
justify-content: flex-end;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-right">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="e">
Result--
<style>
.jc-right {
justify-content: flex-end;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-right">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is basically right-justified. Notice this is different from the reversed one about because the items
stayed in the same order. By default, the <span>justify-content</span> is <span>flex-start</span> which is like
left-justified.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.jc-center {
justify-content: center;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-center">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="e">
Result--
<style>
.jc-center {
justify-content: center;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-center">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And here we see centered boxes. Let's explore the last two which aim to evenly space the boxes out in the space
provided.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.jc-sb {
justify-content: space-between;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-sb">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="e">
Result--
<style>
.jc-sb {
justify-content: space-between;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-sb">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
This one puts the first on the left most and the last on the right most. It then aims to space out the items in
the middle equally. Very useful for laying out columns on your web page. The last two are
<span>space-around</span> and <span>space-evenly</span>. I'm just showing you <span>space-around</span> but
<span>space-evenly</span> is very similar. Feel free to read more into it if you're interested.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.jc-sa {
justify-content: space-around;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-sa">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="e">
Result--
<style>
.jc-sa {
justify-content: space-around;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container jc-sa">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice the space between the items and the edges (as compared to before.)
</p>
<p>So now we've shown you the <span>justify-content</span> property, let's examine <span>align-items</span>.
<span>justify-content</span> worries about horizontal justification and <span>align-items</span> worries about
vertical alignment. Let's take a look at a few examples.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.ai-fe {
align-items: flex-end;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container ai-fe">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="e">

<style>
.ai-fe {
align-items: flex-end;

</style>
<div class="flex-container ai-fe">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice how all the items are now pushed to the bottom of the element, the "end" of it (the opposite is, you
guessed it <span>flex-start</span>.) This isn't always useful but I find myself constantly using the next one
for centering items.
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.ai-center {
align-items: center;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container ai-center">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>

<div class="e">

<div class="flex-container ai-center">
<div class="box-1">1</div>
<div class="box-2">2</div>
<div class="box-3">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Vertically centering something previous to flex was a nightmare. Seriously, Google "vertically center CSS" and
see the decades of anguish on StackOverflow. Luckily for you we now have flex and it makes vertically centering
something as easy as <span>align-items: center</span> in a <span>display: flex</span> tag. Count your lucky
stars!!
</p>
<b>
<xmp>
<style>
.ai-stretch {
align-items: stretch;
height: 200px;
}
/* remove the height from the three boxes */
.no-height {
height: inherit;
}
</style>
<div class="flex-container ai-stretch">
<div class="box-1 no-height">1</div>
<div class="box-2 no-height">2</div>
<div class="box-3 no-height">3</div>
</div>
</xmp>
</b>
<div class="e">

<style>
.ai-stretch {

<div class="flex-container ai-stretch">
<div class="box-1 no-height">1</div>
<div class="box-2 no-height">2</div>
<div class="box-3 no-height">3</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>For this one I did have to remove the heights from the boxes or it overrules the stretch. Stretch makes the
interior tags stretch to fit whatever container they're put in (unless they're limited by a <span>height</span>
already.)
</p>
<p>So now we've gone through the basics of flex. Obviously you can combine these to achieve various effects. We're
going to re-use the CSS classes from above (if you messed with them, just refresh the page.)

<h2>
Further Flex
</h2>
<p>
There's a lot more power with flex you can achieve. You can make multiple rows using <span>flex-wrap</span>.
There are also a slew of properties that the children elements can have (everything we have done so far goes
on the parent class) that you can affect things like order using <span>order</span> and you can individually
override the <span>align-items</span> using <span>align-self</span>. Cool stuff. Definitely dig into it
further.
